(a) Fit a linear model using least squares on the training data. Is there any potential
disadvantage of this model?
```{r}
housing_test = read.csv("./housing_test.csv")
housing_training = read.csv("./housing_training.csv")
```

```{r}
vsSplits <- createDataPartition(y = trainData$Sale_Price,
                                times = 2,
                                p = 0.8,
                                groups = 5,
                                list = FALSE)

head(vsSplits)
```
